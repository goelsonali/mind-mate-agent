# Mind Mate Agent - Enhancement Ideas

## Project Overview
The Mind Mate Agent is a mental wellness assistant built with FastAPI that uses Google's Gemini AI model to provide personalized activities and chat interactions based on a user's mood. The project aims to enhance its functionality by exploring Google Cloud services, Model Context Protocol (MCP), and Google's Agent2Agent Protocol (A2A).

## Core Features to Enhance

### 1. Google Cloud Integration
- **Cloud Run Deployment**
  - Deploy the FastAPI application on Cloud Run for serverless, scalable hosting
  - Enable automatic scaling based on demand

- **Firestore/Datastore**
  - Replace in-memory storage with Firestore for persistent user data
  - Store conversation history, mood patterns, and activity preferences

- **Cloud Functions**
  - Implement serverless functions for mood analysis and activity recommendations
  - Create event-triggered functions for scheduled wellness check-ins

- **Secret Manager**
  - Securely store Gemini API keys and other sensitive information

### 2. Model Context Protocol (MCP) Implementation
- **Enhanced Context Management**
  - Store and retrieve structured context about user interactions
  - Maintain long-term memory of user preferences and history

- **Context Persistence**
  - Maintain conversation context across multiple sessions
  - Enable the model to recall previous interactions and their outcomes

- **Structured Knowledge Representation**
  - Organize mental wellness knowledge in structured formats
  - Support evidence-based recommendations

- **Context-Aware Responses**
  - Tailor responses based on user's historical mood patterns
  - Adjust recommendations based on past effectiveness

### 3. Agent2Agent Protocol (A2A)
- **Specialized Agent Network**
  - Create specialized agents for different aspects of mental wellness:
    - Meditation Coach Agent
    - Physical Activity Agent
    - Journaling Guide Agent
    - Sleep Improvement Agent

- **Collaborative Problem Solving**
  - Enable agents to consult with each other on complex issues
  - Create comprehensive solutions drawing on multiple areas of expertise

- **Context Sharing via MCP**
  - Use MCP to share relevant context between agents
  - Maintain consistency across the agent network

- **Structured Agent Communication**
  - Define protocols for how agents request and provide information
  - Implement a coordinator agent to manage interactions

## Additional Feature Ideas

### Advanced Mood Analysis
- Implement sophisticated sentiment analysis beyond simple keyword detection
- Detect more nuanced emotions (anxiety, contentment, frustration)
- Track mood patterns over time

### Personalization System
- Allow users to set activity preferences and interests
- Implement a recommendation algorithm that learns from activity ratings
- Tailor AI responses based on communication style and past interactions

### Activity Enhancement
- Organize activities by type (physical, creative, social, mindfulness)
- Suggest different activities based on time of day
- Allow users to schedule activities and get reminders
- Track activity completion and wellness journey progress

### Data Analysis
- Analyze user data to provide insights about mood patterns
- Create endpoints for visualization data (charts/graphs)
- Generate summary reports of mood trends and activity engagement

## Implementation Timeline (4-Week Hackathon)

### Week 1
- Set up Google Cloud infrastructure (Cloud Run, Firestore)
- Implement basic MCP structure for context management
- Enhance existing memory manager to use MCP principles

### Week 2
- Create 2-3 specialized agents with distinct expertise
- Implement the A2A protocol for communication between agents
- Develop context sharing mechanisms using MCP

### Weeks 3-4
- Integrate all components into a cohesive system
- Implement advanced features like context-aware recommendations
- Optimize performance and user experience
- Prepare documentation and demo for hackathon presentation

## Technical Considerations
- Design a robust API that the frontend team can easily integrate with
- Implement comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Create a testing framework for the agent network
- Ensure security best practices throughout the implementation

## Code Examples

### MCP Implementation Example
```python
# Enhanced memory manager with MCP principles
class MCPMemoryManager:
    def __init__(self, db_client):
        self.db = db_client
        
    def store_context(self, user_id, context_type, context_data):
        # Store structured context with metadata
        context = {
            "type": context_type,
            "data": context_data,
            "timestamp": datetime.now(),
            "version": "1.0"
        }
        self.db.collection(f"users/{user_id}/contexts").add(context)
        
    def retrieve_context(self, user_id, context_type=None, limit=10):
        # Retrieve relevant context based on type
        query = self.db.collection(f"users/{user_id}/contexts")
        if context_type:
            query = query.where("type", "==", context_type)
        return query.order_by("timestamp", direction="DESCENDING").limit(limit).get()
```

### A2A Implementation Example
```python
# Agent coordinator using A2A protocol
class AgentCoordinator:
    def __init__(self, specialized_agents):
        self.agents = specialized_agents
        
    async def process_request(self, user_id, request, context):
        # Determine which agents should handle the request
        relevant_agents = self._select_relevant_agents(request)
        
        # Collect responses from relevant agents
        responses = []
        for agent in relevant_agents:
            agent_response = await agent.process(user_id, request, context)
            responses.append(agent_response)
            
        # Synthesize a unified response
        return self._synthesize_response(responses)
        
    def _select_relevant_agents(self, request):
        # Logic to determine which specialized agents are relevant to the request
        # This could use keyword matching, intent recognition, or other techniques
        relevant_agents = []
        for agent in self.agents:
            if agent.is_relevant_for(request):
                relevant_agents.append(agent)
        return relevant_agents
        
    def _synthesize_response(self, responses):
        # Logic to combine responses from multiple agents into a coherent reply
        # This could prioritize certain agents, combine suggestions, etc.
        if not responses:
            return {"reply": "I'm not sure how to help with that."}
            
        # Simple example: concatenate all responses
        combined_reply = " ".join([r.get("reply", "") for r in responses])
        return {"reply": combined_reply}
