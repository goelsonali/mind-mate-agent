    1. Option1: Using curl command
        - curl http://localhost:8000/daily-activity/u123?mood=low

    2. (Optional) To test the post endpoint using command line in user-friendly way
        - pip install httpie
        - http POST http://localhost:8000/chat user_id="user123" message="Hello!"
        - http GET http://localhost:8000/daily-activity/user123?mood=excited

- For mood tracking feature
    1. To add the mood data 
        - http POST http://localhost:8000/mood user_id="user123" mood="happy" tracking_date="2025-05-12"
    2. To get the mood data for a user

## Architecture

Mind Mate follows a multi-agent architecture where specialized AI agents handle different aspects of mental wellness:

1. **Main Coordinator Agent** - Central conversational interface with users
2. **Mood Analysis Agent** - Processes emotional detection and sentiment analysis
3. **Activity Recommendation Agent** - Matches current mood to appropriate activities
4. **Feedback Processing Agent** - Captures and analyzes activity effectiveness
5. **Progress Tracking Agent** - Analyzes long-term trends and generates insights

For more details on the architecture, see [mindmate-architecture.md](mindmate-architecture.md).

## Further Enhancements

- Cached Collages: Save and reuse collages for the same mood history to reduce computation
- Custom Layouts: Let users choose between grid, spiral, or timeline layouts
- Advanced Visualization: Use mood statistics to add overlays or captions
- Asynchronous Processing: Use background workers (like Celery) to generate the collage without blocking the API
- Integration with wearable devices for passive mood tracking
- Personalized activity recommendations based on user feedback history
